                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>
                    I've studied game design, art, and programming. I love all three of those knowledge bases. I am passionate about learning, I am ever curious, constantly looking for ways to improve the world around me, and I find joy in the simplest of things. Some of my favorite things to do are read books, play video games, watch anime and movies of all kinds, draw, write, and in general create. I enjoy problem solving and creative solutions which is why this site even came to be in the first place. If you are looking for a creative web developer, designer with technical aptitude, and or an artist that understands technical requirements reach out to me and we'll collaborate to achieve the solutions your business needs.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a record of my programming journey and work. 
Projects currently completed are displayed at the my [portfolio](http://www.luisrodrigueziii.com/) website.   
Projects in progress can be found in this repository.

#### Note
---
Every project live on the website will have a README as well explaining the project. 
Why I made the coding decisions I did. As well as intended future improvements.
